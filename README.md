## About Me

I am a full-stack developer with a strong focus on **scalable system design**, **modern frontend and mobile experiences**, and **reliable backend services**. I build applications with long-term maintainability in mind, balancing performance, developer experience, and business requirements.

My work spans web, mobile, APIs, and background systems, with hands-on experience using **SQL and NoSQL databases**, **state management**, **caching**, and **asynchronous processing**.

- 🔭 Building web and mobile applications using **React**, **Next.js**, and **React Native (Expo)**
- ⚙️ Designing backend services with **Node.js**, **Express**, and modern data layers
- 🧠 Applying clean architecture, scalable patterns, and pragmatic engineering practices
- 🎯 Goal: Deliver reliable, high-impact software that scales with real-world usage
